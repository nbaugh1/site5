This is the first in a multi-part post which will be a walkthrough of setting up a website build using GatsbyJS to generate the actual site and will use the Santiy.io CMS studio as the content portal. I think Sanity did a great job desigining their CMS studio, its full of great features for collaborating with other content creators while keeping the overall feel of the app very minimalistic and intuitive.
