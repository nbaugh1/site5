 So this is where I'll be keeping a blog of my experience going through the Flatiron School's Full Time
Online Software Engineering bootcamp. I'm 4 days way from my official start date of 6/10/19. Up to now 
I've been working on the free pre-bootcamp prep course and currently the Web Development Fundamentals course, 
which is the 100 hours of pre-work that needs to be completed before class actually starts. So far, working 
on these prep courses, I've covered the basics of JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, and CSS. My plan for this blog is 
to explain what I've learned in the previous days studies as a way to reinforce what I've learned.
