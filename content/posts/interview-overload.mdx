I've done more interviews in the past week than I've done in my entire life combined. I survived my first whiteboarding session, although not for a full blown software engineer positon, it was a great expereince and expsosure. I got to get a feel for trends among interview questions, and what type of expertiese I need to be able to explain. The most encouraing outcome from my experiences this week is passsing the challenges presented to me in the whiteboarding session. While I didn't know the exact syntax off hand to handle the problem, I was quickly able to reason out the answers the interviewer was looking for. I'm looking forward to moving forward in developing my skills and knowledge as a developer with this expereince under my belt.
